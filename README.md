ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @gabrielchiarel, and I'm working to become an experient and good software engineer, by now I'm currently studying systems analysis and development
on UNISINOS in Rio Grande do Sul - Brazil.
Lately I'm focused on getting more knowledge about .NET development, that includes REST API, design patterns and code refactoring.
In the future I intend study some javascript framework for front end, like Angular, React or Vue.js
